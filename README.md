# pathfindingalgorithms
Various informed/uninformed path finding algorithms as console applications as well as an input file generator. The various algorithms take ".cav" extension files as input. These consist solely of comma-separated integers and is in the following format. The first value represents how many nodes there are, this can be called N. The next N**2 values represent each node's coordinates. Finally, the values from N**2+1 to the end of the file represent a connectivity matrix which details which node can be accessed from where.

How to use:
1) Run the CavFileGenerator class and follow the steps to create your own ".cav" input file.
2) Take a note of the absolute filepath where this ".cav" is.
3) Run any algorithm and enter the absolute filepath of the ".cav" input file.
